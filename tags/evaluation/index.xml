This post provides a preliminary exploration of the new offerings.</description></item><item><title>ChatGPT Hobbyists</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/mcgee/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 May 2023 10:42:43 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/mcgee/</guid><description>&lt;p>ChatGPT has understandably garnered a huge amount of attention from all corners of academia, from philosophy to economics. One of the more quixotic examples I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered recently is &lt;a href="https://www.robertwmcgee.com/about/">Robert W. McGee&lt;/a>, and his many papers on this topic, such as &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4359405">&amp;ldquo;Is Chat Gpt Biased Against Conservatives? An Empirical Study&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A professor of accounting at Fayetteville University, McGee&amp;rsquo;s biography reads as something like a Marvel Cinematic Universe version of a nerdy academic supervillain. In addition to having published 59 non-fiction books, McGee apparently holds 23 academic degrees, including 13 doctorates, as well as being a world champion in various martial arts, such as Taekwondo and Tai Chi.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>ChatGPT Dominance</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/chatgpt-dominance/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jan 2023 14:39:35 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/chatgpt-dominance/</guid><description>&lt;p>I expect that almost anyone reading this will have heard of ChatGPT by now. Released about a month ago, ChatGPT is a system developed by OpenAI which provides text responses to text input. Although details are scarce, under the hood ChatGPT is basically a large language model, trained with some additional tricks (see Yoav Goldberg&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/yoavg/59d174608e92e845c8994ac2e234c8a9">write up&lt;/a> for a good summary). In other words, it is a model which maps from the text input (treated as a sequence of tokens), to a distribution over possible next tokens, and generates text by making repeated calls to this function, and sampling tokens from the predicted distributions.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
