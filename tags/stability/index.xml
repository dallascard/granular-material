Rather than letting it gestate until more fully formed, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d just post some preliminary thoughts and come back to this at some later date.
The main reason I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about this now is the ongoing debate about how generative AI will impact creative fields, such as writing and design (as well as white collar jobs more broadly).</description></item><item><title>Stability and Change</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/stability/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Mar 2022 17:40:34 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/stability/</guid><description>One of the biggest frustrations with software is that things are constantly changing.

There are many reasons for this of course. For decades, hardware has continued to improve at a steady rate, and so software is constantly being rewritten to take advantage of the latest capabilities. Moreover, the incredibly sloppy standard for software quality and reliability (compared to traditional engineering disciplines) means that even the most professional software is shipped with massive numbers of bugs and vulnerabilities, which constantly need to be patched.</description></item></channel></rss>
