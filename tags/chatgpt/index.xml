The tweet included a link to a text file on pastebin and a screenshot of that same text with newlines removed. More interestingly, the author suggested in a reply that anyone could replicate this finding, and a subsequent tweet included a video of ChatGPT generating text in response to the same trick. That, however, is where things get somewhat strange.</description></item><item><title>University of Michigan's New AI Tools</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/michigan-gpt/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Aug 2023 21:04:19 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/michigan-gpt/</guid><description>Just before the start of the fall semester, the University of Michigan announced that it was launching a new suite of tools, all focused on &amp;ldquo;generative AI&amp;rdquo;, (although so far limited to language models), which will be available to all students, faculty, and staff. This post provides a preliminary exploration of the new offerings.</description></item><item><title>ChatGPT Hobbyists</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/mcgee/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 May 2023 10:42:43 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/mcgee/</guid><description>ChatGPT has understandably garnered a huge amount of attention from all corners of academia, from philosophy to economics. One of the more quixotic examples I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered recently is Robert W. McGee, and his many papers on this topic, such as &amp;ldquo;Is Chat Gpt Biased Against Conservatives? An Empirical Study&amp;rdquo;.
A professor of accounting at Fayetteville University, McGee&amp;rsquo;s biography reads as something like a Marvel Cinematic Universe version of a nerdy academic supervillain.</description></item><item><title>Samsung's Encounter with ChatGPT</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/samsung-chatgpt/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Apr 2023 19:48:46 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/samsung-chatgpt/</guid><description>As ChatGPT continues to ricochet through the news cycle, media outlets are surely on the hunt for new angles they can present to the public in order to keep this story in motion. Among other threads, one that has gained some traction is the question of risks to privacy and security presented by these new systems.
Last week, a number of US outlets reported on data leaks at Samsung, in which three employees (in separate incidents) apparently entered confidential company information into ChatGPT.</description></item><item><title>ChatGPT and Sociotechnical Instability</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/chatgpt_and_instability/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Feb 2023 13:04:13 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/chatgpt_and_instability/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve written about this before, but it&amp;rsquo;s worth remembering that almost nothing in sociotechnical systems is guaranteed to remain stable for very long. We&amp;rsquo;ve recently had two great examples of this, with the first being the changes to Twitter, and the second being ChatGPT (and, by extension, the new Bing).
In the first case, a platform which had long seemed relatively static, (especially compared to all the rest), rather suddenly changed hands, which led to major changes in what it delivered.</description></item><item><title>ChatGPT Dominance</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/chatgpt-dominance/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jan 2023 14:39:35 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/chatgpt-dominance/</guid><description>I expect that almost anyone reading this will have heard of ChatGPT by now. Released about a month ago, ChatGPT is a system developed by OpenAI which provides text responses to text input. Although details are scarce, under the hood ChatGPT is basically a large language model, trained with some additional tricks (see Yoav Goldberg&amp;rsquo;s write up for a good summary). In other words, it is a model which maps from the text input (treated as a sequence of tokens), to a distribution over possible next tokens, and generates text by making repeated calls to this function, and sampling tokens from the predicted distributions.</description></item></channel></rss>
