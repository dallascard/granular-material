From operating systems to apps to web interfaces, things rarely remain the same for very long, especially for users of Windows or MacOS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are many reasons for this of course. For decades, hardware has continued to improve at a steady rate, and so software is constantly being rewritten to take advantage of the latest capabilities. Moreover, the incredibly sloppy standard for software quality and reliability (compared to traditional engineering disciplines) means that even the most professional software is shipped with massive numbers of bugs and vulnerabilities, which constantly need to be patched. This is a particularly large problem in institutional settings which are not set up for this pace of updates; some of the worst effects of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/12/15630354/nhs-hospitals-ransomware-hack-wannacry-bitcoin">WannaCry&lt;/a> ransomware attack, for example, were on hospitals that were still using hopelessly out of date Windows machines.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
