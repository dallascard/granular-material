Rather than letting it gestate until more fully formed, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d just post some preliminary thoughts and come back to this at some later date.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main reason I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about this now is the ongoing debate about how generative AI will impact creative fields, such as writing and design (as well as white collar jobs more broadly). Arguably there have already been some pretty dramatic effects, such as the sci-fi magazine &lt;em>Clarkesworld&lt;/em> being &lt;a href="https://neil-clarke.com/a-concerning-trend/">suddenly overwhelmed&lt;/a> by spammy submissions. At the same time, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to know the extent to which these disruptions may end up being transient phenomena that broader systems will adapt to.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tightly-woven Cultural Commentary</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/interwoven_commentary/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2023 21:57:32 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/interwoven_commentary/</guid><description>&lt;p>I recently started listening to the &lt;a href="https://www.artofthescore.com.au/">Art of the Score&lt;/a> podcast, which does an amazing job of unpacking movie soundtracks in depth, beginning with Raiders of the Lost Ark in the first episode. Like most such explorations of music, however, it ultimately leaves me wanting something that I&amp;rsquo;ve long thought there should be much more of&amp;mdash;namely, more tightly interwoven cultural commentary, especially for music. As I will describe below, I&amp;rsquo;m broadly interested in different ways of combining context, commentary, and criticism with the thing being commented on or critiqued.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Refik Anadol</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/refik-anadol/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 11:05:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/refik-anadol/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last week&amp;rsquo;s speaker in the &lt;a href="https://stamps.umich.edu/penny-stamps-speaker-series">Penny Stamps Speaker Series&lt;/a> was &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refik_Anadol">Refik Anadol&lt;/a>, one of the most successful artists working primarily with AI, data, and visualization. Over a decade or so, Anadol has produced work in collaboration with organizations and venues like the &lt;a href="https://refikanadol.com/works/visions-of-america-ameriques/">LA Philharmonic&lt;/a>, Gaudi&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://refikanadol.com/works/living-architecture-casa-batllo/">Casa Batlló&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://refikanadol.com/works/machine-hallucinations-sphere/">the Exosphere&lt;/a> in Las Vegas, and &lt;a href="https://refikanadol.com/works/unsupervised/">the Museum of Modern Art&lt;/a> in New York.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The lecture he gave was basically a review of his body of work, and that of his art and design studio, which is comprised of about 20 people. The earlier projects he showed mostly took the form of massive scale &lt;a href="https://refikanadol.com/works/quadrature/">light projections&lt;/a> on the sides of buildings, which could give the impression of a totally different texture or form. More recent work tended to use data driven visualizations, abstracting some sort of data into visual patterns displayed on a wall, building, or screen. Many of these also made use of what appeared to be procedural animations to create the impression of three dimensionality and motion.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Reproducibility in Art and Science</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/reproducibility-in-art-and-science/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jun 2017 20:43:20 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/reproducibility-in-art-and-science/</guid><description>&lt;p>Marking the beginning of a new &lt;a href="http://rhizome.org/editorial/2017/may/30/rhizome-google-partnership/">partnership&lt;/a> between Rhizome and the Google Cultural Institute, the Rhizome blog recently published a &lt;a href="http://rhizome.org/editorial/2017/may/30/preservation-by-accident-is-not-a-plan/">conversation&lt;/a> between Dragan Espenschied, Rhizome’s preservation director, and Vint Cerf, Google’s Chief Internet Evangelist. In addition to bringing together two people with among the coolest job titles ever, it got me thinking about some similarities between art and science when it comes to the issue of reproduction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main thrust of the conversation is about the difficulty of preserving internet art. In particular, works such as &lt;a href="https://anthology.rhizome.org/the-web-stalker">The Web Stalker&lt;/a> were often made in a particular context, intended to be performances of a sort, and which depended on the existence of a certain technical infrastructure, including a particular operating system, a particular input device, an internet connection, and accompanying protocols. Part of the conversation relates to the fact that it’s actually very difficult to maintain or recreate every single thing that is required in order for a modern viewer to have the exact same experience as when it was first created. Nevertheless, Dragan argues, there is still value in preserving part of the experience.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
