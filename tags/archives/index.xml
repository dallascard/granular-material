Written by Stefan Baack and Mozilla Insights, the report is based on both public documents and new interviews with Common Crawl&amp;rsquo;s current director and crawl engineer, and goes into some detail about the history of the organization, and how its data is being used.</description></item><item><title>Refik Anadol</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/refik-anadol/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 11:05:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/refik-anadol/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last week&amp;rsquo;s speaker in the &lt;a href="https://stamps.umich.edu/penny-stamps-speaker-series">Penny Stamps Speaker Series&lt;/a> was &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refik_Anadol">Refik Anadol&lt;/a>, one of the most successful artists working primarily with AI, data, and visualization. Over a decade or so, Anadol has produced work in collaboration with organizations and venues like the &lt;a href="https://refikanadol.com/works/visions-of-america-ameriques/">LA Philharmonic&lt;/a>, Gaudi&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://refikanadol.com/works/living-architecture-casa-batllo/">Casa Batlló&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://refikanadol.com/works/machine-hallucinations-sphere/">the Exosphere&lt;/a> in Las Vegas, and &lt;a href="https://refikanadol.com/works/unsupervised/">the Museum of Modern Art&lt;/a> in New York.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The lecture he gave was basically a review of his body of work, and that of his art and design studio, which is comprised of about 20 people. The earlier projects he showed mostly took the form of massive scale &lt;a href="https://refikanadol.com/works/quadrature/">light projections&lt;/a> on the sides of buildings, which could give the impression of a totally different texture or form. More recent work tended to use data driven visualizations, abstracting some sort of data into visual patterns displayed on a wall, building, or screen. Many of these also made use of what appeared to be procedural animations to create the impression of three dimensionality and motion.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ubi Sunt</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/ubi_sunt/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Sep 2023 13:05:18 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/ubi_sunt/</guid><description>&lt;p>There is a duality at the heart of large language models. On the one hand, they are essentially a backwards-looking invention, a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/k7rPtFLH6yw?si=bD6ir6cwtpOtEV0i">&amp;ldquo;cultural technology&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>, in the words of Alison Gopnik&amp;mdash;algorithms which index and remix a large slice of human culture (though one that is typically heavily biased towards the recent past). On the other hand, they can often seem to be producing something entirely new, and can thereby leave many people with the impression of having a personality or even &amp;ldquo;sentience&amp;rdquo; (whatever that means exactly); in the most extreme cases, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/NgHFMolXs3U?si=gfKBPeOlEhQeDdEg">some people&lt;/a> have apparently convinced themselves that such models are a step on the path towards some sort of successor species to humanity, a new regime of algorithmic children that will survive our own human catastrophes. Complicating matters here is the fact that the emergence of and widespread attention to these systems largely overlapped with the Covid-19 pandemic, a time in which we have all had additional reason to reflect on life, death, loss, and creation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Gradual Disappearance of Twitter</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/twitter-immolation/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jun 2023 10:42:43 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/twitter-immolation/</guid><description>&lt;p>It was &lt;a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/twitter-researchers-delete-data-unless-pay-2364535">recently reported&lt;/a> by inews.co.uk that Twitter is going to start charging academic researchers and institution $42,000/month if they want to maintain their current level of expansive access to data, and &amp;ndash; more significantly &amp;ndash; require that they delete all Twitter data from their archives if they do not. I&amp;rsquo;d heard rumors that this might be happening a few weeks ago, but the iNews article is the first independent reporting that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen about it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>ChatGPT and Sociotechnical Instability</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/chatgpt_and_instability/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Feb 2023 13:04:13 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/chatgpt_and_instability/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve written about this &lt;a href="https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/stability/">before&lt;/a>, but it&amp;rsquo;s worth remembering that almost nothing in sociotechnical systems is guaranteed to remain stable for very long. We&amp;rsquo;ve recently had two great examples of this, with the first being the changes to Twitter, and the second being ChatGPT (and, by extension, the new Bing).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the first case, a platform which had long seemed relatively static, (especially compared to all the rest), rather suddenly changed hands, which led to major changes in what it delivered. On some level, many of the technical changes to the actual functionality of the site were relatively minor. Much bigger, however, was the impact of many people abandoning the platform for alternatives like Mastodon. Although it seems to me like people have gradually been filtering back to Twitter, most people seem to have the sense that the experience has changed. Obviously more dramatic infrastructural changes, like prioritizing tweets from paying users, could produce even more dramatic shifts. Regardless, it&amp;rsquo;s a good reminder that what we think of as &amp;ldquo;Twitter&amp;rdquo; is the product of a combination of people and software, either or both of which can shift dramatically in a short period of time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Counting Deaths</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/counting-deaths/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 May 2022 17:24:13 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/counting-deaths/</guid><description>Although morbid, it&amp;rsquo;s fascinating to read a recent article in the NYT about efforts in Sierra Leone to use &amp;ldquo;electronic autopsies&amp;rdquo; in a large scale attempt at counting deaths. According to the article, this undertaking is part of a broader effort at data collection, including questions on age, religion, marital status, etc. The novelty, it seems, is in trying to be thorough with respect to what people have died of (including extensive questions about symptoms), even though this information is being collected potentially long after the fact.</description></item><item><title>Stability and Change</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/stability/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Mar 2022 17:40:34 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/stability/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the biggest frustrations with software is that things are constantly changing. From operating systems to apps to web interfaces, things rarely remain the same for very long, especially for users of Windows or MacOS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are many reasons for this of course. For decades, hardware has continued to improve at a steady rate, and so software is constantly being rewritten to take advantage of the latest capabilities. Moreover, the incredibly sloppy standard for software quality and reliability (compared to traditional engineering disciplines) means that even the most professional software is shipped with massive numbers of bugs and vulnerabilities, which constantly need to be patched. This is a particularly large problem in institutional settings which are not set up for this pace of updates; some of the worst effects of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/12/15630354/nhs-hospitals-ransomware-hack-wannacry-bitcoin">WannaCry&lt;/a> ransomware attack, for example, were on hospitals that were still using hopelessly out of date Windows machines.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Emergent Archives</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/emergent-archives/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Nov 2017 22:12:15 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/emergent-archives/</guid><description>&lt;figure>&lt;img src="../../img/emergent-archives/archives.jpg">
&lt;/figure>

&lt;p>It’s fascinating to think about how much we give to the internet, and sometimes, how much it gives back. In my mind, there is a fairly direct historical connection between self-archiving practices from a couple of decades ago (keeping a diary, making photo albums, writing letters, etc.), to all the more recent variations on this idea (status updates, tweets, photo feeds, etc.). The difference is arguably in how much of the background work is taken care of for us, and the fact that we now make so much of this information public or semi-public. While many have explored the implications of this for privacy, security, and surveillance, there is another aspect that gets less attention: the automatic creation of our own archives.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Montage as Archive</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/montage-as-archive/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Nov 2017 22:07:35 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/montage-as-archive/</guid><description>&lt;p>I was recently reminded of Christian Marclay’s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clock_(2010_film)">&lt;em>The Clock&lt;/em>&lt;/a>&amp;mdash;a 24 hour film made up of thousands of short film clips, carefully edited together such that (when properly synchronized) the time depicted in each moment of film corresponds to the current time in the world. I’ve never seen it, and sadly only a few copies exist, but I think it’s a fascinating example of a kind of archival art.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you hear the description, you might think of it as just a kind of a gimmick, one which would not reward actual viewing. However, based on the (bootlegged) clips that are &lt;a href="https://kottke.org/13/06/about-an-hour-of-christian-marclays-the-clock">available online&lt;/a> and reports from various people who have seen it, it apparently achieves much more. To be clear, although many of the scenes involve a shot of some sort of time piece (thereby establishing the time in the source film), the composition is not so simple as just finding and assembling shots of clocks. Rather, we see a slice in time, sometimes with intercutting between films. As a result, common patterns quickly emerge: in the morning we get people waking up. In the evening, we see people eating dinner and attending parties, etc. This is interesting because what is shown in films bears some relation to what happens in the real world; even if it ends up being a distorted or idealized reflection, this certainly tells us something about how Hollywood depicts society, and by implication, something about society itself.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Self-Archiving machine</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/self-archiving-machine/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 May 2017 20:47:34 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/self-archiving-machine/</guid><description>What lies in store for this post? As I write this, it exists in a strange space — not yet public, yet already part of an archive, of a kind. Perhaps it cannot yet even be properly called a post, (since it has not yet been posted), and yet it is there for me to read and edit, part of my collection of unpublished stubs, stored on the Medium servers along with who knows what metadata.</description></item></channel></rss>
