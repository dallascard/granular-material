Since coming into office, the new administration has been carrying out actions that many legal experts suggest are illegal. In several cases since then, judges have issued orders which demand a pause on particular actions. Most recently, the New York Times reports that a judge has now ruled that the White House has failed to comply with a court order. While less splashy than various overt actions, this kind of failure act seems to me like to very close to the red line suggested by various commentators, including conservatives.</description></item><item><title>Infinitely Wide Culture</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/infinitely-wide-culture/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jan 2024 15:59:40 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/infinitely-wide-culture/</guid><description>&lt;p>A lot of this is still unresolved in my mind, but I think there is something interesting happening at the intersection of generative AI, art, style, and entertainment. Rather than letting it gestate until more fully formed, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d just post some preliminary thoughts and come back to this at some later date.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main reason I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about this now is the ongoing debate about how generative AI will impact creative fields, such as writing and design (as well as white collar jobs more broadly). Arguably there have already been some pretty dramatic effects, such as the sci-fi magazine &lt;em>Clarkesworld&lt;/em> being &lt;a href="https://neil-clarke.com/a-concerning-trend/">suddenly overwhelmed&lt;/a> by spammy submissions. At the same time, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to know the extent to which these disruptions may end up being transient phenomena that broader systems will adapt to.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Gradual Disappearance of Twitter</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/twitter-immolation/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jun 2023 10:42:43 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/twitter-immolation/</guid><description>&lt;p>It was &lt;a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/twitter-researchers-delete-data-unless-pay-2364535">recently reported&lt;/a> by inews.co.uk that Twitter is going to start charging academic researchers and institution $42,000/month if they want to maintain their current level of expansive access to data, and &amp;ndash; more significantly &amp;ndash; require that they delete all Twitter data from their archives if they do not. I&amp;rsquo;d heard rumors that this might be happening a few weeks ago, but the iNews article is the first independent reporting that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen about it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>ChatGPT and Sociotechnical Instability</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/chatgpt_and_instability/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Feb 2023 13:04:13 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/chatgpt_and_instability/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve written about this &lt;a href="https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/stability/">before&lt;/a>, but it&amp;rsquo;s worth remembering that almost nothing in sociotechnical systems is guaranteed to remain stable for very long. We&amp;rsquo;ve recently had two great examples of this, with the first being the changes to Twitter, and the second being ChatGPT (and, by extension, the new Bing).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the first case, a platform which had long seemed relatively static, (especially compared to all the rest), rather suddenly changed hands, which led to major changes in what it delivered. On some level, many of the technical changes to the actual functionality of the site were relatively minor. Much bigger, however, was the impact of many people abandoning the platform for alternatives like Mastodon. Although it seems to me like people have gradually been filtering back to Twitter, most people seem to have the sense that the experience has changed. Obviously more dramatic infrastructural changes, like prioritizing tweets from paying users, could produce even more dramatic shifts. Regardless, it&amp;rsquo;s a good reminder that what we think of as &amp;ldquo;Twitter&amp;rdquo; is the product of a combination of people and software, either or both of which can shift dramatically in a short period of time.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
