Among other threads, one that has gained some traction is the question of risks to privacy and security presented by these new systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last week, a number of US outlets &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/article/samsung-chatgpt-leak-details">reported&lt;/a> on data leaks at Samsung, in which three employees (in separate incidents) apparently entered confidential company information into ChatGPT. According to &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/three-samsung-employees-reportedly-leaked-sensitive-data-to-chatgpt-190221114.html">reports&lt;/a>, in one case, an employee tried using ChatGPT to help debug code, another to optimize code, and a third to have it produce a summary of meeting notes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Counting Deaths</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/counting-deaths/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 May 2022 17:24:13 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/counting-deaths/</guid><description>Although morbid, it&amp;rsquo;s fascinating to read a recent article in the NYT about efforts in Sierra Leone to use &amp;ldquo;electronic autopsies&amp;rdquo; in a large scale attempt at counting deaths. According to the article, this undertaking is part of a broader effort at data collection, including questions on age, religion, marital status, etc. The novelty, it seems, is in trying to be thorough with respect to what people have died of (including extensive questions about symptoms), even though this information is being collected potentially long after the fact.</description></item><item><title>AI Dermatology: Part 1</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/ai-dermatology-1/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Feb 2022 07:32:51 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/ai-dermatology-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>Midway through last year Google &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/health/ai-dermatology-preview-io-2021/">announced&lt;/a> a new foray into the medical technology space, sharing that it was developing an &amp;ldquo;AI-powered dermatology assist tool&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;a phone-based app that would allow users to take photos of skin lesions and retrieve information about relevant medical conditions from the web. &lt;a href="https://www.skinvision.com/">Similar&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aidermatologist&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;gl=US">apps&lt;/a> already exist, but it&amp;rsquo;s fair to say that a comparable effort by Google is likely to have much more significant effects on how people interact with the medical system, their personal data, and even their own bodies.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
