The article was heavy on images and light on text, but the overall theme was the tension between the company&amp;rsquo;s GPT models&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->—&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->which have been trained on vast swaths of human culture, and are therefore able to regurgitate, remix, and approximate it&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->—&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->versus embracing the design and aesthetic trappings of a traditional library reading room. The article mentioned a handful of books that could be found in the OpenAI library, but many more were clearly visible in the photographs that accompanied it.</description></item><item><title>Infinitely Wide Culture</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/infinitely-wide-culture/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jan 2024 15:59:40 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/infinitely-wide-culture/</guid><description>&lt;p>A lot of this is still unresolved in my mind, but I think there is something interesting happening at the intersection of generative AI, art, style, and entertainment. Rather than letting it gestate until more fully formed, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d just post some preliminary thoughts and come back to this at some later date.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main reason I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about this now is the ongoing debate about how generative AI will impact creative fields, such as writing and design (as well as white collar jobs more broadly). Arguably there have already been some pretty dramatic effects, such as the sci-fi magazine &lt;em>Clarkesworld&lt;/em> being &lt;a href="https://neil-clarke.com/a-concerning-trend/">suddenly overwhelmed&lt;/a> by spammy submissions. At the same time, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to know the extent to which these disruptions may end up being transient phenomena that broader systems will adapt to.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ubi Sunt</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/ubi_sunt/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Sep 2023 13:05:18 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/ubi_sunt/</guid><description>&lt;p>There is a duality at the heart of large language models. On the one hand, they are essentially a backwards-looking invention, a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/k7rPtFLH6yw?si=bD6ir6cwtpOtEV0i">&amp;ldquo;cultural technology&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>, in the words of Alison Gopnik&amp;mdash;algorithms which index and remix a large slice of human culture (though one that is typically heavily biased towards the recent past). On the other hand, they can often seem to be producing something entirely new, and can thereby leave many people with the impression of having a personality or even &amp;ldquo;sentience&amp;rdquo; (whatever that means exactly); in the most extreme cases, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/NgHFMolXs3U?si=gfKBPeOlEhQeDdEg">some people&lt;/a> have apparently convinced themselves that such models are a step on the path towards some sort of successor species to humanity, a new regime of algorithmic children that will survive our own human catastrophes. Complicating matters here is the fact that the emergence of and widespread attention to these systems largely overlapped with the Covid-19 pandemic, a time in which we have all had additional reason to reflect on life, death, loss, and creation.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
