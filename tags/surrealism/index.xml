Comprised of three pieces&amp;mdash;&lt;em>The Missing Door&lt;/em>, &lt;em>The Lost Room&lt;/em> and &lt;em>The Hidden Floor&lt;/em>&amp;mdash;created in 2013, 2015, and 2017, respectively, the performance ran just over two hours, including a partial intermission. This post is a bit of a break from what I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing lately, but it feels worth highlighting, if only to help keep at least some attention on artistic endeavours. Just as a warning, I have not refrained from spoiling anything in here, so you might want to stop reading if you&amp;rsquo;re planning to see it and want the full effect.</description></item></channel></rss>
