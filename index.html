<h3 class="h2 post-title">Vaccine Allocation at Stanford Hospital </h3>
<p class=post-summary>In a video that was widely shared last Friday, a representative from Stanford Medical Center spoke to residents protesting how the hospital chose to allocate its first shipment of COVID-19 vaccines. The hospital had around 5,000 initial doses to distribute (and expects to have tens of thousands more within the next few weeks), and came up with an allocation scheme in which only 7 of the approximately 1,300 residents were on the list. Many of these residents deal directly with patients who have COVID-19, whereas other more senior physicians, as well as other front line workers, such as nurses and food service employees, were given priority. In the video, the spokesperson explains that the algorithm they used to come up with an allocation scheme “clearly didn’t work”, to which protestors respond by shouting “Algorithms suck!” and “Fuck the algorithm!” &mldr;</p>

<h3 class="h2 post-title">The case for professional critics in science </h3>
<p class=post-summary>In many areas of science, there is an increasingly urgent unmet need, a role that could be simultaneously fascinating, rewarding, and potential remunerative. It is a role that already exists in various forms, but which could be made into something much more potent, especially if forces converged to make it more prominent. I am talking, of course, about the professional science critic.
In the popular imagination, science operates something like a priesthood: scientists enter elite institutions as novices and emerge years later as full-fledged representatives of The Truth.</p>

<p>Although it isn’t normally thought of in these terms, taking a photograph involves recording a four-dimensional block of space-time and projecting it down to a two-dimensional representation. With sufficiently sensitive material (and a fast enough shutter), one can produce images more or less instantaneously, but longer exposures reveal the inherent temporality of this process, showing us something that is clearly based on the world, yet quite different from our experience of it. Today, the ability to create images is so commonplace, of course, that we easily take it for granted, but early commentaries on photography reveal just how extraordinary it once was. Indeed, the history of photography provides both a compelling example of the power of representation, and a useful parallel to more recent forms of technological magic, especially that of machine learning.</p></p>

<p>For anyone who has been paying attention, it will not have gone unnoticed that the past year has seen a dramatic expansion in the use of face recognition technology, including at schools, border crossing, and interactions with the police. Most recently, <a href=https://news.delta.com/delta-unveils-first-biometric-terminal-us-atlanta-next-stop-detroit>Delta announced</a> that some passengers in Atlanta will be able to check in and go through security using only their face as identification. Most news coverage of this announcement emphasized the supposed convenience, efficiency, and technical novelty, while underplaying any potential hazards. In fact, however, the combination of widely available images, the ability to build on existing infrastructure, and a legal landscape that places very few restrictions on recording, means that face recognition represents a unique threat to privacy that should concern us greatly.</p></p>
