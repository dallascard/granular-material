In part 1, I went through a basic overview of some of the differences in terms of syntactic style and defaults. In part 2, I went slightly deeper into some of the interactive features and more fundamental limitations. In this part, I want to deepen the comparison further, by exploring the basic capabilities each package offers with respect to a basic chart type, namely scatterplots.</description></item><item><title>The OpenAI Library</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/openai-library/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 May 2024 12:52:46 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/openai-library/</guid><description>The New York Times recently ran a brief article about the reading room in OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s office in San Francisco. The article was heavy on images and light on text, but the overall theme was the tension between the company&amp;rsquo;s GPT models&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->—&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->which have been trained on vast swaths of human culture, and are therefore able to regurgitate, remix, and approximate it&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->—&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->versus embracing the design and aesthetic trappings of a traditional library reading room. The article mentioned a handful of books that could be found in the OpenAI library, but many more were clearly visible in the photographs that accompanied it.</description></item><item><title>Sociotechnical Considerations</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/sociotechnical-considerations/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Apr 2024 13:42:01 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/sociotechnical-considerations/</guid><description>A whole genre of podcasts seems to have emerged recently, taking the shape of interviews with CEOs of AI companies, or similar. Although I have not listened to many of these, they mostly seem to be pretty abysmal, both because of the amount of hype they involve, and due to the lack of meaningful specifics.
That being said, of the ones I&amp;rsquo;ve heard, the recent interview with Dario Amodei of Anthropic on the Ezra Klein Show seems to me to be vastly better than the average.</description></item><item><title>Financing Common Crawl</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/financing-common-crawl/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Mar 2024 20:08:01 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/financing-common-crawl/</guid><description>Mozilla recently published an excellent new report out about Common Crawl, the non-profit whose web crawls have played an important role in the development of numerous large language models (LLMs). Written by Stefan Baack and Mozilla Insights, the report is based on both public documents and new interviews with Common Crawl&amp;rsquo;s current director and crawl engineer, and goes into some detail about the history of the organization, and how its data is being used.</description></item><item><title>ChatGPT Prompt Speculations</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/chatgpt-prompt-speculations/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Feb 2024 10:00:26 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/chatgpt-prompt-speculations/</guid><description>In a recent tweet that went viral, Dylan Patel claimed to have discovered or revealed the ChatGPT prompt, using a simple hack. The tweet included a link to a text file on pastebin and a screenshot of that same text with newlines removed. More interestingly, the author suggested in a reply that anyone could replicate this finding, and a subsequent tweet included a video of ChatGPT generating text in response to the same trick. That, however, is where things get somewhat strange.</description></item><item><title>Infinitely Wide Culture</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/infinitely-wide-culture/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jan 2024 15:59:40 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/infinitely-wide-culture/</guid><description>A lot of this is still unresolved in my mind, but I think there is something interesting happening at the intersection of generative AI, art, style, and entertainment. Rather than letting it gestate until more fully formed, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d just post some preliminary thoughts and come back to this at some later date.
The main reason I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about this now is the ongoing debate about how generative AI will impact creative fields, such as writing and design (as well as white collar jobs more broadly).</description></item><item><title>Tightly-woven Cultural Commentary</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/interwoven_commentary/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2023 21:57:32 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/interwoven_commentary/</guid><description>I recently started listening to the Art of the Score podcast, which does an amazing job of unpacking movie soundtracks in depth, beginning with Raiders of the Lost Ark in the first episode. Like most such explorations of music, however, it ultimately leaves me wanting something that I&amp;rsquo;ve long thought there should be much more of&amp;mdash;namely, more tightly interwoven cultural commentary, especially for music. As I will describe below, I&amp;rsquo;m broadly interested in different ways of combining context, commentary, and criticism with the thing being commented on or critiqued.</description></item><item><title>Altair vs. Bokeh (part 2)</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/altair_vs_bokeh_2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Nov 2023 18:17:35 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/altair_vs_bokeh_2/</guid><description>In the first part of this series, I used a basic bar plot to illustrate the differences between Altair and Bokeh in terms of defaults, chart configuration, and syntactic style. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll get into some of the more substantive differences, including more complicated chart types, combining plots, basic interactivity, and how to deploy the output online. Note that this is not intended to be a systematic comparison, but rather more of a preliminary exploration of the options.</description></item><item><title>Refik Anadol</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/refik-anadol/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 11:05:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/refik-anadol/</guid><description>Last week&amp;rsquo;s speaker in the Penny Stamps Speaker Series was Refik Anadol, one of the most successful artists working primarily with AI, data, and visualization. Over a decade or so, Anadol has produced work in collaboration with organizations and venues like the LA Philharmonic, Gaudi&amp;rsquo;s Casa Batlló, the Exosphere in Las Vegas, and the Museum of Modern Art in New York.
The lecture he gave was basically a review of his body of work, and that of his art and design studio, which is comprised of about 20 people.</description></item><item><title>Ubi Sunt</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/ubi_sunt/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Sep 2023 13:05:18 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/ubi_sunt/</guid><description>There is a duality at the heart of large language models. On the one hand, they are essentially a backwards-looking invention, a &amp;ldquo;cultural technology&amp;rdquo;, in the words of Alison Gopnik&amp;mdash;algorithms which index and remix a large slice of human culture (though one that is typically heavily biased towards the recent past). On the other hand, they can often seem to be producing something entirely new, and can thereby leave many people with the impression of having a personality or even &amp;ldquo;sentience&amp;rdquo; (whatever that means exactly); in the most extreme cases, some people have apparently convinced themselves that such models are a step on the path towards some sort of successor species to humanity, a new regime of algorithmic children that will survive our own human catastrophes.</description></item><item><title>University of Michigan's New AI Tools</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/michigan-gpt/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Aug 2023 21:04:19 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/michigan-gpt/</guid><description>Just before the start of the fall semester, the University of Michigan announced that it was launching a new suite of tools, all focused on &amp;ldquo;generative AI&amp;rdquo;, (although so far limited to language models), which will be available to all students, faculty, and staff. This post provides a preliminary exploration of the new offerings.</description></item><item><title>Altair vs. Bokeh (part 1)</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/altair_vs_bokeh_1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jul 2023 18:17:35 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/altair_vs_bokeh_1/</guid><description>This is the first of what I hope will be a series of posts comparing Altair and Bokeh. Both are actively supported python packages for making interactive visualizations. This post will only scratch the surface, but is intended to show the basic differences in how they approach creating visualizations.</description></item><item><title>The Gradual Disappearance of Twitter</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/twitter-immolation/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jun 2023 10:42:43 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/twitter-immolation/</guid><description>It was recently reported by inews.co.uk that Twitter is going to start charging academic researchers and institution $42,000/month if they want to maintain their current level of expansive access to data, and &amp;ndash; more significantly &amp;ndash; require that they delete all Twitter data from their archives if they do not. I&amp;rsquo;d heard rumors that this might be happening a few weeks ago, but the iNews article is the first independent reporting that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen about it.</description></item><item><title>ChatGPT Hobbyists</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/mcgee/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 May 2023 10:42:43 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/mcgee/</guid><description>ChatGPT has understandably garnered a huge amount of attention from all corners of academia, from philosophy to economics. One of the more quixotic examples I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered recently is Robert W. McGee, and his many papers on this topic, such as &amp;ldquo;Is Chat Gpt Biased Against Conservatives? An Empirical Study&amp;rdquo;.
A professor of accounting at Fayetteville University, McGee&amp;rsquo;s biography reads as something like a Marvel Cinematic Universe version of a nerdy academic supervillain.</description></item><item><title>Samsung's Encounter with ChatGPT</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/samsung-chatgpt/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Apr 2023 19:48:46 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/samsung-chatgpt/</guid><description>As ChatGPT continues to ricochet through the news cycle, media outlets are surely on the hunt for new angles they can present to the public in order to keep this story in motion. Among other threads, one that has gained some traction is the question of risks to privacy and security presented by these new systems.
Last week, a number of US outlets reported on data leaks at Samsung, in which three employees (in separate incidents) apparently entered confidential company information into ChatGPT.</description></item></channel></rss>
