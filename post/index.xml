To put the people out of doubt
How many of the plauge do die;
We sume them up most carefully

Bill of Morality, 1665.
Although morbid, it&amp;rsquo;s fascinating to read a recent article in the NYT about efforts in Sierra Leone to use &amp;ldquo;electronic autopsies&amp;rdquo; in a large scale attempt at counting deaths.</description></item><item><title>Modular Domain Adaptation</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/modular/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Apr 2022 20:16:54 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/modular/</guid><description>Despite their limitations, off-the-shelf models are still quite widely used by computational social science researchers for measuring various properties of text, including both lexicons, like LIWC, and cloud-based APIs, like Perspective API. The approach of using an off-the-shelf model has some definite advantages, including standardization and reproducibility, but such models may not be reliable when applied to a domain that differs from the ones on which they were developed&amp;hellip;</description></item><item><title>Stability and Change</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/stability/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Mar 2022 17:40:34 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/stability/</guid><description>One of the biggest frustrations with software is that things are constantly changing. From operating systems to apps to web interfaces, things rarely remain the same for very long, especially for users of Windows or MacOS.
There are many reasons for this of course. For decades, hardware has continued to improve at a steady rate, and so software is constantly being rewritten to take advantage of the latest capabilities. Moreover, the incredibly sloppy standard for software quality and reliability (compared to traditional engineering disciplines) means that even the most professional software is shipped with massive numbers of bugs and vulnerabilities, which constantly need to be patched.</description></item><item><title>Confidence in Science</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/confidence-in-science/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Mar 2022 09:20:14 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/confidence-in-science/</guid><description>I’ve been thinking recently about the role of confidence in science, and how long beliefs can persist simply because everyone else seems to believe them. Coincidentally, Andrew Gelman posted about this two days ago, responding to comments from a biologist about how the replication crisis had not been a major problem in biology. Her argument was that this was because biology is a &amp;ldquo;cumulative science&amp;rdquo;. By this she meant that when something important gets published, it is often the kind of discovery that people want to use immediately.</description></item><item><title>AI Dermatology: Part 2</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/ai-dermatology-2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Feb 2022 16:26:43 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/ai-dermatology-2/</guid><description>​In the last post, I discussed the possible broader implications of Google&amp;rsquo;s recent foray into making an AI dermatology tool. In this follow up post, I want to focus on the research behind the product announcement, bringing a slightly critical eye.</description></item><item><title>AI Dermatology: Part 1</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/ai-dermatology-1/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Feb 2022 07:32:51 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/ai-dermatology-1/</guid><description>Midway through last year Google announced a new foray into the medical technology space, sharing that it was developing an &amp;ldquo;AI-powered dermatology assist tool&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;a phone-based app that would allow users to take photos of skin lesions and retrieve information about relevant medical conditions from the web. Similar apps already exist, but it&amp;rsquo;s fair to say that a comparable effort by Google is likely to have much more significant effects on how people interact with the medical system, their personal data, and even their own bodies.</description></item><item><title>Vaccine Allocation at Stanford Hospital</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/stanford-vaccines/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Dec 2020 21:43:54 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/stanford-vaccines/</guid><description>In a video that was widely shared last Friday, a representative from Stanford Medical Center spoke to residents protesting how the hospital chose to allocate its first shipment of COVID-19 vaccines. The hospital had around 5,000 initial doses to distribute (and expects to have tens of thousands more within the next few weeks), and came up with an allocation scheme in which only 7 of the approximately 1,300 residents were on the list. Many of these residents deal directly with patients who have COVID-19, whereas other more senior physicians, as well as other front line workers, such as nurses and food service employees, were given priority. In the video, the spokesperson explains that the algorithm they used to come up with an allocation scheme “clearly didn’t work”, to which protestors respond by shouting “Algorithms suck!” and “Fuck the algorithm!” &amp;hellip;</description></item><item><title>The case for professional critics in science</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/science-critics/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Oct 2020 21:24:17 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/science-critics/</guid><description>In many areas of science, there is an increasingly urgent unmet need, a role that could be simultaneously fascinating, rewarding, and potential remunerative. It is a role that already exists in various forms, but which could be made into something much more potent, especially if forces converged to make it more prominent. I am talking, of course, about the professional science critic.
In the popular imagination, science operates something like a priesthood: scientists enter elite institutions as novices and emerge years later as full-fledged representatives of The Truth.</description></item><item><title>Representational Power</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/representational-power/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jul 2019 21:27:37 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/representational-power/</guid><description>&lt;figure>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/View_from_the_Window_at_Le_Gras">&lt;img src="../img/representational-power//plate.jpeg"

&lt;p>Although it isn’t normally thought of in these terms, taking a photograph involves recording a four-dimensional block of space-time and projecting it down to a two-dimensional representation. With sufficiently sensitive material (and a fast enough shutter), one can produce images more or less instantaneously, but longer exposures reveal the inherent temporality of this process, showing us something that is clearly based on the world, yet quite different from our experience of it. Today, the ability to create images is so commonplace, of course, that we easily take it for granted, but early commentaries on photography reveal just how extraordinary it once was. Indeed, the history of photography provides both a compelling example of the power of representation, and a useful parallel to more recent forms of technological magic, especially that of machine learning.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>On the Perils of Automated Face Recognition</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/face-recognition/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Dec 2018 21:59:04 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/face-recognition/</guid><description>&lt;figure>&lt;a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bertillon,_Alphonse,_fiche_anthropom%C3%A9trique_recto-verso.jpg">&lt;img src="../img/face-recognition/bertillon.jpeg"

&lt;p>For anyone who has been paying attention, it will not have gone unnoticed that the past year has seen a dramatic expansion in the use of face recognition technology, including at schools, border crossing, and interactions with the police. Most recently, &lt;a href="https://news.delta.com/delta-unveils-first-biometric-terminal-us-atlanta-next-stop-detroit">Delta announced&lt;/a> that some passengers in Atlanta will be able to check in and go through security using only their face as identification. Most news coverage of this announcement emphasized the supposed convenience, efficiency, and technical novelty, while underplaying any potential hazards. In fact, however, the combination of widely available images, the ability to build on existing infrastructure, and a legal landscape that places very few restrictions on recording, means that face recognition represents a unique threat to privacy that should concern us greatly.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What everyone needs to know about interpretability in machine learning</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/interpretability/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 May 2018 20:46:57 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/interpretability/</guid><description>For anyone who’s been paying attention, it should be apparent that statistical machine learning systems are being widely deployed for automated decision making in all kinds of areas these days, including criminal justice, medicine, education, employment, policing, and so on. Particularly with the recently enacted GDPR&amp;mdash;the new European regulation about data and privacy&amp;mdash;there is growing interest in having systems that are interpretable, that is, we can make some sense of why they are making the prediction that they are making. To borrow an example from Been Kim, if a computer tells you that you need surgery, you’re probably going to ask for some sort of explanation.</description></item><item><title>Privacy in Context</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/privacy-in-context/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 May 2018 23:09:37 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/privacy-in-context/</guid><description>Although it was not the largest of its kind, or the most invasive, or even particularly surprising, the recent Cambridge Analytica scandal produced a surprisingly large amount of outrage and commentary. If nothing else, it was yet another reminder that we have gradually slipped into a regime where certain aspects of our privacy that could once be taken for granted are now long gone. Are people concerned? Is this something we should be worried about?</description></item><item><title>Emergent Archives</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/emergent-archives/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Nov 2017 22:12:15 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/emergent-archives/</guid><description>&lt;figure>&lt;img src="../img/emergent-archives/archives.jpg"/>

&lt;p>It’s fascinating to think about how much we give to the internet, and sometimes, how much it gives back. In my mind, there is a fairly direct historical connection between self-archiving practices from a couple of decades ago (keeping a diary, making photo albums, writing letters, etc.), to all the more recent variations on this idea (status updates, tweets, photo feeds, etc.). The difference is arguably in how much of the background work is taken care of for us, and the fact that we now make so much of this information public or semi-public. While many have explored the implications of this for privacy, security, and surveillance, there is another aspect that gets less attention: the automatic creation of our own archives.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Montage as Archive</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/montage-as-archive/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Nov 2017 22:07:35 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/montage-as-archive/</guid><description>I was recently reminded of Christian Marclay’s The Clock&amp;mdash;a 24 hour film made up of thousands of short film clips, carefully edited together such that (when properly synchronized) the time depicted in each moment of film corresponds to the current time in the world. I’ve never seen it, and sadly only a few copies exist, but I think it’s a fascinating example of a kind of archival art.
When you hear the description, you might think of it as just a kind of a gimmick, one which would not reward actual viewing.</description></item><item><title>Reproducibility in Art and Science</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/reproducibility-in-art-and-science/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jun 2017 20:43:20 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/reproducibility-in-art-and-science/</guid><description>Marking the beginning of a new partnership between Rhizome and the Google Cultural Institute, the Rhizome blog recently published a conversation between Dragan Espenschied, Rhizome’s preservation director, and Vint Cerf, Google’s Chief Internet Evangelist. In addition to bringing together two people with among the coolest job titles ever, it got me thinking about some similarities between art and science when it comes to the issue of reproduction.
The main thrust of the conversation is about the difficulty of preserving internet art.</description></item><item><title>The Self-Archiving machine</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/self-archiving-machine/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 May 2017 20:47:34 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/self-archiving-machine/</guid><description>What lies in store for this post? As I write this, it exists in a strange space — not yet public, yet already part of an archive, of a kind. Perhaps it cannot yet even be properly called a post, (since it has not yet been posted), and yet it is there for me to read and edit, part of my collection of unpublished stubs, stored on the Medium servers along with who knows what metadata.</description></item><item><title>Elbow Room</title><link>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/elbow-room/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Mar 2017 20:52:03 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://dallascard.github.io/granular-material/post/elbow-room/</guid><description>&lt;figure>&lt;img src="../img/elbow-room/thinker.jpeg"/>

&lt;p>Daniel Dennett is one of the most fascinating philosophers currently living. Although he pursued a traditional (but nonetheless exceptional) course of education, over time he seems to have moved farther and farther away from traditional philosophical methods and styles, and more toward a form of engagement that is simultaneously rigorous, original, and accessible. Not only is he prolific, he is far better informed on scientific topics than any other philosopher I can think of, and seems to have quite intentionally pursued a course through the relevant fields of inquiry in order to develop a sophisticated understanding of what we are as human beings.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
